# wslShellExtension

As of January 30, the windows terminal project (https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) supports cmdline options for launching with a specific profile or working dir.<br>

This ps1 script installs a right click menu for wsl and powershell that use this terminal (need to build from source for now)<br>

You'll probably have to modify the paths to where you build terminal.

Note I couldn't find a repeatable path for the ubuntu ico, so I just downloaded one and threw it here.
